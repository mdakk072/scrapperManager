utils.py

This module provides utility functions for common tasks such as file I/O,
logging, and timestamp generation. The Utils class offers various static methods
for interacting with YAML and JSON files, setting up logging, creating directories,
and generating timestamps. These utilities are designed to simplify the development
of web scraping projects and other applications that require basic file and logging
operations.
